                    Food purchases made by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had been a mystery, but a recent report helps provide some clarity. </p>
                <p> <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/ops/SNAPFoodsTypicallyPurchased-Summary.pdf">According to the report by the USDA,</a> which oversees the program, SNAP households and non-SNAP households make similar choices at the
                    supermarket. The data was collected from over 26.5 million households through a year, who receive about $256.11 monthly. While the two households differed in certain spending categories, like sweetened beverages, the difference was
                    less than 2 percent. Both households spent a bulk of their grocery budget on the same categories, demonstrating that they make similar choices in food. </p>

                    Despite these findings state lawmakers in <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/314824-food-stamp-junk-food-ban-advances-in-ark">Arkansas, Maine, Tennessee and Montana </a> have tried to introduce measures in the last few
                    weeks that would restrict SNAP recipients from purchasing foods deemed unhealthy by the state public health officials. </p>
                <p>
                    <h3> "Most of the time people who use food stamps to purchase unhealthy snacks is because they are cheaper," said Cherise Paumel, 23, whose mother and grandmother rely on SNAP. </h3> </p>

                <p>
                    She also pointed out that people who need SNAP might work longer hours and have less time to cook, which could explain why they are slightly more likely to buy frozen or pre-packaged food items than non-SNAP households. </p>

                    Restricting foods from SNAP because theyâ€™re unhealthy can get tricky too.
                </p>


                <p>
                    <h3>
                    "It would be really complicated to define what we consider healthy food," said Dr. Beth Weitzman, a professor of public health and policy at NYU. </h3> </p>


                <p>

                    That's why the USDA has been reluctant to implement such measure. But Weitzman also added that it could be argued soda is not a food item at all since it has zero nutritional value. She suggested that public health officials address the issue more holistically
                    by imposing a soda tax instead, which would affect non-SNAP households as well. </p>


                <p>

                    "You can't just single out poor people if you're looking for a solution," she said.
                </p>
